	 * { } → a block of code

	 * 
	 * “Casting” is a process of converting a value from one type to another We can
	 * cast Primitive and Nonprimitive
	 * 
	 * 2 types of casting : Widening/ Implicit/ Automatic Narrowing/ Explicit/
	 * Manual
	 * 
	 * Byte → short → int → long → float → double Each one of these is a different
	 * size, getting bigger. Java will automatically be able to store a smaller
	 * “box” into a bigger “box”. This is Widening. Implicit Casting.
	 * 
	 * Double → float → long → int → short → byte Each one of these is a different
	 * size, getting smaller. Java cannot automatically store a bigger “box” into a
	 * smaller “box”. ERROR. Because some of the data will be lost. So, when
	 * Narrowing, you have to do it explicitly. Manually. Ex. int num=(int)10.99;
	 * will become “10” because some data was lost, so it rounds down.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Operators: Assignment: = Arithmetical: +, -, *, /, % Relational and equality:
	 * >, >=, <, <=, ==, !=
	 * 
	 * Result of relational and equality operators ALWAYS boolean value (T/F)
	 * 
	 * 
	 * If statement SYNTAX OF IF STATEMENT: If (boolean condition) { (code); }
	 * —--------------------------------------------------------- If Else statement
	 * If (boolean condition) { (code); }else { (code); }
	 * —---------------------------------------------------------- If Else If
	 * statement if (condition1){ Code A; } else if (condition2) { Code B; } else if
	 * (condition3) { Code C; } else { Else code; }
